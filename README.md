# bootstrap-template
A starter template for [Bootstrap v5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/).
In this project, you'll be able to use this starter template, over and over again when using **Bootstrap v5.2**.

*Note: Please make sure you're using [Bootstrap v5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) when looking over documentation*

### CDN vs Download
We're using Bootstrap CDN vs Download because
- Faster connection when reaching Bootstrap servers
- Save more memory by not adding ALL styles from Bootstrap

## Getting Started
1. Make sure to fork off of this repository to create a copy of this template.
2. `git clone SSH/HTTPREMOTELINK` into desired directory in your local computer.
3. Make sure to `cd` into recently cloned repository, and you'll see ALL the started files connected and ready to go.
4. Code away, and make sure to use [Bootstrap v5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) version when looking over documentation. Happy coding!
